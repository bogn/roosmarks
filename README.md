I've got this idea that I can use a simple bookmarking service (like [delicious][] or [pinboard][]) as a more effective research tool than it is now.  I'm using this app to explore whether my thoughts make any sense, at all.

It's currently hosted on heroku at [chrisroos-bookmarks][]

[delicious]: http://delicious.com/
[pinboard]: http://pinboard.in/
[chrisroos-bookmarks]: http://chrisroos-bookmarks.heroku.com/
