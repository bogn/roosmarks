* Auto expand the text box as you're typing.

* Add preview functionality to markdown descriptions

* Trying to bookmark a URL that's already been bookmarked should show me the existing data and allow me to amend it, instead of presenting a completely new form for completion.  Maybe the bookmarklet could automatically open the edit form and that could redirect if such a bookmark doesn't exist.  To do that, I guess I'd need to use the url (or some hash of the url) instead of the internal bookmark id that i'm currently using.

* Consider auto-linking @username's to twitter URLs...  Maybe they could default to auto-linking to twitter but you could configure it to link to that person's identity elsewhere online.

* Consider displaying "related tags" when viewing a specific tag.  E.g. Viewing "indieweb" might show me tags for "self-hosted-software".

* DRY up the bookmarks new and edit templates.

* DRY up h1 page title and html head title

* Maybe separate bookmarks into week/some-other-time-period buckets

* Allow bookmarks to be deleted

* Display some pretty stats about the number of bookmarks per domain.  Maybe I could have /domain/imgur.com, for example?

* Add atom feed for tag pages

* Ensure tag pages aren't polluting google search results

* Add searching of bookmarks

* Create a simple chrome extension that'll tell me whether I've previously bookmarked the page I'm looking at - I think this'll be easier when I have a page per bookmark (as I should then be able to do HEAD /bookmarks/<identifier> to determine whether I've bookmarked something or not)

* Add autocomplete for tag suggestions

* Display the date of the roosmark

* Multiple comments per bookmark

* Tag slugs (e.g. /tags/funnies, rather than /tags/999)

* Ad-hoc notes against tags (similar to pinboard's idea of notes)

* Display acronyms differently?  If I use something like ISS - International Space Station then using ISS again will autocomplete to an abbr tag?  Or maybe autocomplete to a link to the wikipedia article?

* Close the bookmarklet popup window after successfully adding a bookmark.

* Allow singular 'bookmarks' to be displayed.  This might become more relevant if/when you can add multiple comments to a bookmark.

* Is there a way of automatically associating a bookmark with another URL/bookmark. I'm thinking about all the bookmarks I've found because of Gina's google plus post.  Maybe just a referrer/via/hat-tip type field is good enough?  Maybe I could have some shortcut that pulls up an autocomplete list of all other bookmarks I've saved - that'd make it easier to bookmark (in this example) Gina's post and then autocomplete a link to that when I'm bookmarking all the services referred to within it.

* Do I need to update the Heroku installation instructions now that Cedar is the default stack and shared-database has been deprecated in favour of pg:dev?

* Add categories/tags to the atom feed

* Can/Should I display the favicon next to bookmarked sites?
  - I can do this very very naively with something like `= image_tag "http://#{bookmark.domain}/favicon.ico"`.  Ignoring hotlinking concerns, I'm not even sure that I should do it from a visual point of view.

* Can/Should I display images inline?  Maybe I can use oEmbed for this?

* Can/Should I display videos inline?  Maybe I can use oEmbed for this?
