* Display the date of the roosmark

* Multiple comments per bookmark

* Tag slugs (e.g. /tags/funnies, rather than /tags/999)

* Ad-hoc notes against tags (similar to pinboard's idea of notes)

* Display acronyms differently?

* Useful error messages when bookmark addition fails (e.g. due to validation error) - see the wip-display-validation-errors branch

* Close the bookmarklet popup window after successfully adding a bookmark.

* Add Travis-CI build status to CI

* Allow singular 'bookmarks' to be displayed.  This might become more relevant if/when you can add multiple comments to a bookmark.

* Bookmarks should be editable.

* Is there a way of automatically associating a bookmark with another URL/bookmark. I'm thinking about all the bookmarks I've found because of Gina's google plus post.  Maybe just a referrer/via/hat-tip type field is good enough?
