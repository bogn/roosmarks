* Different page title for different pages

* Maybe separate bookmarks into week/some-other-time-period buckets

* Allow bookmarks to be deleted

* Display some pretty stats about the number of bookmarks per domain.  Maybe I could have /domain/imgur.com, for example?

* Add atom feed for main page

* Add atom feed for tag pages

* Ensure tag pages aren't polluting google search results

* Add searching of bookmarks

* Create a simple chrome extension that'll tell me whether I've previously bookmarked the page I'm looking at

* Add autocomplete for tag suggestions

* Display the date of the roosmark

* Multiple comments per bookmark

* Tag slugs (e.g. /tags/funnies, rather than /tags/999)

* Ad-hoc notes against tags (similar to pinboard's idea of notes)

* Display acronyms differently?

* Close the bookmarklet popup window after successfully adding a bookmark.

* Allow singular 'bookmarks' to be displayed.  This might become more relevant if/when you can add multiple comments to a bookmark.

* Bookmarks should be editable.

* Is there a way of automatically associating a bookmark with another URL/bookmark. I'm thinking about all the bookmarks I've found because of Gina's google plus post.  Maybe just a referrer/via/hat-tip type field is good enough?

* What does Brakeman say about roosmarks?

* Do I need to update the Heroku installation instructions now that Cedar is the default stack and shared-database has been deprecated in favour of pg:dev?
